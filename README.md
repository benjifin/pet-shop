# What does this repo contain?

Some experiments to learn more about authentication and authorisation in practice.

There are two parts:

1. *Tutorials*: A folder of tutorials completed to learn more about the topic (full details in the Readme)
2. *Shop*: My authentication app written from what I've learnt during tutorials & other reading.
